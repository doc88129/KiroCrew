"""Rotating hot backups of every memory store.

The gap this closes is not subtle. Memory is the one thing here that cannot be
rebuilt from anywhere else — config can be retyped and sessions replayed, but a
superseded preference nobody remembers stating is gone — and until now its whole
durability story was a manual ``kirocrew snapshot``. An operator who never ran it
had no copy, which is exactly how a 36 MB store became 29 bytes with nothing to
restore from.

Deliberately NOT the snapshot machinery. That is a tar of many components with
redaction, upload paths and a purpose model, aimed at moving an install somewhere
else; this is one cheap file copy aimed at surviving the next corruption. Sharing
code would drag redaction and component resolution onto a path that must be able to
run unattended every day and finish in milliseconds.

Uses SQLite's ONLINE BACKUP API (``Connection.backup``), not a file copy. That is
the difference between a backup and a coin flip: the gateway holds the store open
under WAL, so ``shutil.copy`` of ``memory.db`` alone captures a file whose committed
tail lives in a ``-wal`` sibling it did not take, and the result parses cleanly while
missing recent writes. The backup API walks a consistent snapshot with the writer
still running, and produces a single self-contained file with no WAL to pair.

Backups live beside the store they came from, inside ``memory_stores/<name>/`` for a
silo, so a store's backups inherit the fence that store already sits behind and no
new sensitive-path entry is needed. The default store's go under the data home in
their own directory.
